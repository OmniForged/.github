# OmniForge

**Forging intelligent systems that think ahead.**

OmniForge is an open-source organization focused on building **AI-first tools** that remove friction between humans and systems. We design software that is proactive, autonomous, and opinionated — tools that *act before you ask*.

Our work lives at the intersection of:
- Artificial Intelligence & Automation
- Developer Productivity
- Human-centric System Design
- Real-world Problem Solving

We care less about hype and more about **usable intelligence**.

## 🚀 Flagship Project

### Brody
**An autonomous AI assistant that prepares your day for you.**

Brody unifies calendars, tasks, and communication to generate **context, summaries, and action points proactively** — before meetings, deadlines, or decisions.

🔗 Repository: https://github.com/OmniForged/Brody

Brody represents OmniForge’s core belief:  
software should anticipate intent, not wait for commands.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Most tools are reactive.  
We build **anticipatory systems**.

Most software increases cognitive load.  
We aim to **remove it**.

Most automation is brittle.  
We design for **adaptability and iteration**.

OmniForge projects are:
- Open by default
- Modular by design
- Built for contributors, not gatekeepers

---

## 🤝 Open Source & Contributions

OmniForge is open-source because leverage comes from **communities, not silos**.

You can contribute by:
- Picking up issues labeled `good first issue`
- Improving documentation and developer experience
- Proposing architectural or product-level improvements
- Stress-testing ideas with real usage

If you think deeply about systems, tradeoffs, and scale — you’ll fit right in.

## 🗺️ Road Ahead

OmniForge is a long-term playground for:
- Autonomous agents
- AI-driven orchestration tools
- Developer-centric automation
- Research-backed but production-ready ideas

Brody is just the beginning.

## 📬 Get Involved

- ⭐ Star repositories to signal interest
- 🧠 Start discussions with ideas or critiques
- 🔧 Submit PRs — small or ambitious

We value **clarity over noise**, **impact over polish**, and **thinking over trend-chasing**.
